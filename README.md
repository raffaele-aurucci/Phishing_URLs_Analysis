# Phishing URLs Analysis

Project of course **Statistic and Data Analysis** - University of Salerno

## Introduction
In recent years, the exponential growth of the Internet and the increasing number of devices connected to the network have profoundly transformed the way we access online services. 
However, this development has also expanded the attack surface for cybercriminals, leading to a significant rise in threatsâ€”particularly phishing attacks. 
Phishing is one of the most widespread and dangerous techniques, aimed at deceiving users into revealing sensitive information through fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate ones.

In the context of this project, starting from a dataset containing various features extracted from both legitimate and phishing websites sourced from the work of [P. Arvind et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103545), 
*"PhiUSIIL: A Diverse Security Profile Empowered Phishing URL Detection Framework Based on Similarity Index and Incremental Learning"*, 
exploratory and statistical analyses were conducted to identify the features that most effectively distinguish between legitimate and phishing sites. 
Additionally, the reliability of predictive models, particularly regression and clustering techniques, was assessed when applied to this data. 
Special attention was given to comparing real data with synthetic data generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), 
in order to analyze potential differences in statistical properties and predictive performance.

## Methodology
This work was carried out with the following methodology:

1. Analyze the dataset extracted from the precedent work in order to identify the features that offer the highest discriminative power between the two categories (**phishing** and **legitimate**).
2. Evaluate whether the synthetic data generated by LLMs, specifically **OpenAI's o3-mini**, preserve the same statistical properties as real data through descriptive analyses.
3. Compare the performance of predictive models, including **regression** and **clustering** techniques, applied to both real and synthetic data, to highlight potential differences in structure and reliability between the two datasets.
4. Examine the possibility of mapping the features generated by LLMs to known statistical distributions (e.g., Normal, Binomial, etc.).
